## Description

SONA is an online software created by [SONA
Systems](https://www.sona-systems.com/){target="_blank"}, several
universities and private research companies use similar software to keep
track of research participants and their compensation after
participating in a study.

The Department of Psychology and Child Development has its own instance
using this software, you may log in by going to the portal on this
[link](https://csustan.sona-systems.com/){target="_blank"}.

If you are taking my class, it is likely I already added you to SONA's
database, therefore you will be able to create new studies on SONA.

I will show you on this tutorial how to create a new study on SONA.

### Step 1

Go to the psychology log in web page by [clicking
here.](https://csustan.sona-systems.com/){target="_blank"}

The webpage should look like the picture below:

### Step 2

Type your CSU Stan email as your `User ID`, and the password you set
before. You may have recieved an email with a random temporal password.
You may continue using the random password or change it to a more
friendly and secure password.

### Step 3

You will see a page similar to the one showed next. But, in your case it
should say that you have two roles, one role is `participant` and the
other is `researcher`. Select your role as `researcher` to start
creating your new study. In my case, I have two roles, I'm
`administrator` and `principal investigator`.

### Step 4

Once you select your role as `researcher` , you will see the following
page:

![](step4.png)

Click on ***"Create a new study"*** as showed in the picture.

### Step 5

You will see a new page after clicking on ***"Create a new study"***. In
this new page, you will see multiple options. In most cases, the right
option is "Online External Study" as shown in the image below:

![](step5.png)

Select the option that says "Credit", we don't have money to pay for
participation {{< fa face-sad-tear size=1x style="color: #0f0f10;" >}}. After that,
click on "Continue"

### Step 6

In this step you will have to type specific information related to
your research project:

- Study Name
- Brief Abstract
- Detailed Description
- Eligibility Requirements: add requirement such as minimum age to participante.
- Duration in minutes (write how long it takes to finish the survey)
- How many credits will the participant earn after participating in your study? (You can specify 1 credit).
- Preparation is optional. Keep it blank if you don't need to add information in this
section.
- Researcher: Look for my name and your group members in the list. Double click
on the names to add them to the study as researchers. If you have the option to 
specify a principal investigator you can add me there.
- YOU MUST add your IRB approval number.
- YOU MUST add your IRB approval expiration.
- Approved? This is an option administrated by the general admin. This means
that another faculty who is the general admin has to approve your project.
- Study URL: you should add your Qualtrics link in this section. 

You may ignore the rest of the options and keep the default values. 

### Step 6

After creating the study, you should click on "Study Menu" , and then
click on "View/Administer Time Slots":

### Step 7

Now click on "Add a Timeslot":

### Step 8

Finally, set a Final Participation Date, normally the last day of classes should
be appropriate. Set a final time, and type the maximum number of
participants. Add a large number such as 300 participants. You will not get
300 students but it is just better if you give a large number to the software.

### Step 9 

After you finish all these steps, your project will be ready to be delivered
on SONA but, there is an extra step: you have to ask for
approval to the general admin, you will make the request by clicking: "Send
request". The admin will return the decision with comments if 
there are problems with the submission.

II {background-image=\"slide2.png\" background-opacity=\"0.5\"}\n\n-   Pure experiments need a control group to account for *counterfactual* information, this also helps\nto rule out possible *confounding variables*.\n    - Example: how would you measure the effect of physical activity on cardiovascular fitness?

But, do we need counterfactual information? \n\n![](meme1.jpg){fig-align=\"right\"}\n\n## But we haven't defined cause, and effect {background-image=\"slide2.png\" \nbackground-opacity=\"0.5\" .smaller}\n\n@shadish2002experimental :\n\n- Let's try an example, consider a forest fire:\n  - Multiple causes: match tossed from a car, a lightning strike, or a \n    smoldering campfire\n  - None of these causes is necessary because a forest fire can start even when,\n    say, a match is not present. Also, none of them is sufficient to start the fire. After\n    all, a match must stay \"hot\" long enough to start combustion; it must contact  \n    combustible material such as dry leaves.

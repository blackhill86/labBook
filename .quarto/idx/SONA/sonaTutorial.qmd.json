You may have recieved an email with a random temporal password.\nYou may continue using the random password or change it to a more\nfriendly and secure password.\n\n### Step 3\n\nYou will see a page similar to the one showed next. But, in your case it\nshould say that you have two roles, one role is `participant` and the\nother is `researcher`. Select your role as `researcher` to start\ncreating your new study. In my case, I have two roles, I'm\n`administrator` and `principal investigator`.\n\n![](step3.png)\n\n### Step 4\n\nOnce you select your role as `researcher` , you will see the following\npage:\n\n![](step4.png)\n\nClick on ***\"Create a new study\"*** as showed in the picture.\n\n### Step 5\n\nYou will see a new page after clicking on ***\"Create a new study\"***. In\nthis new page, you will see multiple options. In most cases, the right\noption is \"Online External Study\" as shown in the image below:\n\n![](step5.png)\n\nSelect the option that says \"Credit\", we don't have money to pay for\nparticipation {{< fa face-sad-tear size=1x style=\"color: #0f0f10;\" >}}. After that,\nclick on \"Continue\"\n\n### Step 6\n\nIn this step you will have to type specific information related to\nyour research project:\n\n- Study Name\n- Brief Abstract\n- Detailed Description\n- Eligibility Requirements: add requirement such as minimum age to participante.\n- Duration in minutes (write how long it takes to finish the survey)\n- How many credits will the participant earn after participating in your study? (You can specify 1 credit).\n- Preparation is optional. Keep it blank if you don't need to add information in this\nsection.\n- Researcher: Look for my name and your group members in the list. Double click\non the names to add them to the study as researchers. If you have the option to \nspecify a principal investigator you can add me there.\n- YOU MUST add your IRB approval number.\n- YOU MUST add your IRB approval expiration.\n- Approved? This is an option administrated by the general admin. This means\nthat another faculty who is the general admin has to approve your project.\n- Study URL: you should add your Qualtrics link in this section. \n\nYou may ignore the rest of the options and keep the default values. \n\n### Step 6\n\nAfter creating the study, you should click on \"Study Menu\" , and then\nclick on \"View/Administer Time Slots\":\n\n![](step6.png)\n\n### Step 7\n\nNow click on \"Add a Timeslot\":\n\n![](step7.png)\n\n### Step 8\n\nFinally, set a Final Participation Date, normally the last day of classes should\nbe appropriate. Set a final time, and type the maximum number of\nparticipants. Add a large number such as 300 participants. You will not get\n300 students but it is just better if you give a large number to the software.\n\n![](step8.png)\n\n\n### Step 9 \n\nAfter you finish all these steps, your project will be ready to be delivered\non SONA but, there is an extra step: you have to ask for\napproval to the general admin, you will make the request by clicking: \"Send\nrequest\". The admin will return the decision with comments if \nthere are problems with the submission. \n\n![](step9_2.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Description\n\nSONA is an online software created by [SONA\nSystems](https://www.sona-systems.com/){target=\"_blank\"}, several\nuniversities and private research companies use similar software to keep\ntrack of research participants and their compensation after\nparticipating in a study.\n\nThe Department of Psychology and Child Development has its own instance\nusing this software, you may log in by going to the portal on this\n[link](https://csustan.sona-systems.com/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nIf you are taking my class, it is likely I already added you to SONA's\ndatabase, therefore you will be able to create new studies on SONA.\n\nI will show you on this tutorial how to create a new study on SONA.\n\n### Step 1\n\nGo to the psychology log in web page by [clicking\nhere.](https://csustan.sona-systems.com/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nThe webpage should look like the picture below:\n\n![](step1.png)\n\n### Step 2\n\nType your CSU Stan email as your `User ID`, and the password you set\nbefore.

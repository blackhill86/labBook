# Welcome to my Seminar in Social Psychology!

The Seminar in Social Psychology is in reality an excuse to conduct research in a wide number of topics. The main goal in simple words is to provide a space where the students can take their first steps to prepare a research proposal, and create a scientific poster.

On the top of the picture it says \" research in social psychology\" inside the trojan horse it says \"R code\", and there is a castle named \"students\". The trojan horse was send to the castle, in this case, the students." width="300"}

In this course I usually try to add some `R` code along with stats, because why not? statistics are everywhere and they are fun!

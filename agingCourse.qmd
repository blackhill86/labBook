# Life span and aging

As a researcher I'm interested in studying developmental changes in aging adults. I focus on healthy aging, and sometimes I study dementia. I combine these topics with my passion with statistical methods.

Given my goals, I decided to teach the course *Adulthood and Aging* at CSU Stan. This section is dedicated to share my slides with any person who finds my materials useful. But, I aim primarily to create lectures for students at CSU Stan.

You may see the slides in the next section.
